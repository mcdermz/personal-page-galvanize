            I mentioned on the first page that I became interested in programming as part of a solution to change my life for the better. I have several goals that I would like to accomplish, both during the Galvanize program and further into my career:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li><b>Get a job.</b> This may seem obvious but it’s also very important. I need to pay off my loans somehow!</li>
          <li><b>Learn the fundamentals</b> of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hone those skills to the point where I become an attractive candidate for tech positions, ideally for companies in creative industries (such as music or film). </li>
          <li><b>Learn how to learn</b> new technologies. One of the first things I discovered about this industry is that it is always changing. Being able to adapt to rapidly changing environments and processes will be a huge advantage in what will be a very competitive market and I intend to embrace that concept wholeheartedly. </li>
          <li><b>Become a competent, jack-of-all-trades full-stack developer</b>, but also choose a path to specialize in and ultimately master. I do not know what this path will be, whether it’s backend, front end, CSS ninja,  or data analytics, but I know that I will be much more valuable as a developer if I can do something better than most. </li>
          <li><b>Learn to collaborate.</b> Honestly one of the biggest draws of working in tech for me was the opportunity to collaborate with others on a regular basis. I’ve always thrived in a group environment and I love the exchange of ideas and methods to come up with the best final product. </li>
          <li>Ultimately <b>make my way back into the music industry.</b> This was touched on before but it’s a big reason I chose to switch careers to Web Development. Tech is now an industry that is prevalent and essential to every other industry. As said before I thrive in collaborative environments and I would love nothing more than to go back to my community not only as a musician/sound engineer but also as a skilled web dev who can provide unique insights to help contribute to worthwhile projects. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
          That's it for goals (for now). I'm so excited to get started and really delve into this whole new world. I'm very grateful for the opportunity and look forward to seeing what I can accomplish!
